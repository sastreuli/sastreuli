    I am an anthropologist who uses a biocultural approach to examine the ways in which social inequality is embodied to produce negative health outcomes for marginalized women. My research is particularly focused around issues of public health, refugee experiences, gender, race, class, psychosocial stress, migration, and trauma. I am also passionate about educational accessibility and solving social problems using innovative, technology-based approaches. I am also experienced in project management, front end web development, database development and management, grant application and administration, and research.

      <strong>Gender Role Overload and Cardiometabolic Disease Risk in Somali Refugee Women.</strong> <em>PhD Dissertation.</em>
This project aims to use a biocultural, intersectional, community-engaged approach to investigate issues of gender role overload, immigration-related stress, and health in Somali refugee women. This project uses a combination of ethnographic methods, focus groups, and epidemiological methods to address the ways in which experiences of multiple forms of marginalization produce negative health outcomes for Somali refugee women.
    </p>
     <p><strong>Genotyping, Phenotyping, and Stereotyping: Rationalizing Race in the Genomic Era.</strong> 
This is an interdisciplinary project involving members of the Communications and Anthropology departments at UC San Diego. The aim of this project is to understand how race is socially constructed, and how these constructions are affected by the introduction of genetic ancestry information.  Additionally, this project will explore issues of racial self-identification and the social categorization of race. I am designing a <a href="https://sstrudel.github.io/sstrudel/">website</a> and survey for this project and will be responsible for web marketing to ensure wide dissemination of the survey. In order to pursue this project, members of our research group have been awarded the UC San Diego Interdisciplinary Collaboratories Fellowship.
      </p>
      <p><strong>The Use of Racial Terminology in Biological Anthropology.</strong>
This project consists of a systematic analysis of biological anthropology literature from the 1950’s on to determine how racial terminology has been used within the field, and how its use has changed through time.  Special emphasis is placed on terminology referring specifically to White and Hispanic/Latino individuals.
      </p>
      <p><strong>Maize, Meat, and Migration: Stable Isotope Analysis at Chalcatzingo, Morelos, Mexico.</strong>  <em>M.A. Thesis.</em>
I performed stable isotopic analyses on human remains from the Formative Period site of Chalcatzingo in Morelos, Mexico.  The aim of this project was to determine the diets of these individuals using stable carbon and nitrogen isotopes, and to assess possible dietary disparities high and low status individuals.  Additionally, I assessed migration patterns among this population using stable oxygen isotope values.
